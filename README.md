PERI Finance is a crpyto-backed synthetic asset platform forking from Synthetix.

It is powered by USDC Stablecoin and PERI, the Peri Protocol Token. PERI and USDC holders can stake them into PERI Liquidity Pool to issue Pynth called pUSD. 



## Future Plan

### Exchange
Users will be able to converting one Pynth to another without worrying about how deep the liquidity nor slippage. Users will also be able to be benefited by taking short or long positions of Pynths with 20x leverage.  
Prices will be committed on chain by a trusted oracle. Moving to a decentralised oracle will be phased in with the first phase completed for all forex prices using [Chainlink](https://feeds.chain.link/).

### DAO
PERI tokens are also used for governance. We have created a PIP (PERI Improvement Proposals) system to collect community opinions.

### Peri Embraces NFTs
Artists and investors are both greatly rewarded and monetized by minting Peri token.  

---
PERI Finance will be a decentralized cross-chain synthetic issuance and derivative exchange protocol that provides unlimited liquidity on Polkadot network. It gives the opportunity to accessing a wide range of traditional financial and crypto assets in the forms of both leveraged and unleveraged synthetic products without high GAS fee, slow transaction speed and vulnerability to front-running or flash loan.
